Installation
Sedapp is a model written in R. The R scripts could be run directly in your PCs provide an R environment is available.
Note:
R packages listed below are needed before the running:
"smoothr", "Matrix", "stats", "graphics", "grDevices" "utils", "datasets", "methods", "base", "Rcpp".
RStudio of Windows is a preferable IDE since Package ‘rstudioapi’ is also used in Sedapp_v2021.
